    <p>Hello! I hope you're having a great day. My name is Lincoln, I'm 32 years old, and I've been a public servant in the state of Paraná, Brazil, for 10 years. My professional journey has been entirely dedicated to the public administration of health.</p>

    <p>Recently, I completed my degree in Systems Analysis and Development (ADS). However, I realized that, due to the nature of public competitions, my current field no longer offers opportunities for growth. I am constantly seeking to enhance my knowledge and achieve a more comprehensive professional development.</p>

    <p>With determination, teamwork skills, patience, and a passion for interacting with people, I face new challenges every day. My goal is to transition to the field of Information Technology (IT), where I see an environment conducive to personal, professional, and financial growth.</p>

    <p>Additionally, I have intermediate proficiency in English and dedicate part of my day to improving my speaking skills. However, my current challenge and objective are to secure an international job, receiving payment in foreign currency. Due to the devaluation of salaries in my country, I am seeking opportunities that can provide fair compensation.</p>

    <p>I am willing to start either remotely or on-site, if necessary and feasible. This decision not only represents a personal challenge but also a pursuit of new perspectives and professional achievements.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my site and getting to know a bit more about me. I am looking forward to the opportunities that the future holds. Feel free to explore other sections of the site to learn more about my journey and skills.</p>
