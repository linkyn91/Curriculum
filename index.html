    <p>Hello! I hope you're having a great day.</p>

    <p>My name is Lincoln, and I'm 32 years old. I've been a public servant in the state of Paran√°, Brazil, for 10 years, entirely dedicated to the administrative public health sector.</p>

    <p>Recognizing that the nature of public exams limits growth opportunities, I recently graduated in Systems Analysis and Development. I am continuously seeking to enhance my knowledge and professional growth. Currently, I am studying and practicing daily through online courses to transition to the IT field, where I perceive a conducive environment for personal, professional, and financial growth.</p>

    <p>In terms of skills and abilities:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I have intermediate English proficiency and dedicate daily time to improving my speaking skills.</li>
        <li>I am a determined individual, work well in a team, am patient, and enjoy interacting with people.</li>
        <li>I thrive on facing new challenges and maintain a constant desire to learn new things.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My current challenge and objective include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overcoming the obstacle of securing a good international job without prior experience, with the aim of receiving payment in foreign currency.</li>
        <li>Due to the salary devaluation in my country, seeking opportunities abroad is a strategy to achieve fair compensation.</li>
        <li>I am willing to start either remotely or on-site, if necessary and viable.</li>
        <li>Fearlessly, I am here, taking risks to give my best and secure my first international job.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I appreciate your visit to my site and for getting to know a bit more about me. I am eagerly anticipating the opportunities that the future holds. Feel free to explore other sections of the site to discover more about my journey and skills.</p>
